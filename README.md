# Loan-Approval-Project
•	Developed a machine learning pipeline for loan approval prediction, including data cleaning and
 performance evaluation using a confusion matrix.
•	Implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers for performance comparison.
•	Enhanced model performance by encoding standardizing features, addressing missing values, and 
evaluating results through precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
